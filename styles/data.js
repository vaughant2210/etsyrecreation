I do not use recycled leather, upholstery leather, or vinyl leather. This stuff is the real deal and comes from a dead animal. The above mentioned leather substitutes are great if you don&#39;t want that amazing leather smell and feel and are ok with an imitation. Because my items come from things that were once alive their hides can have imperfections. Cows like people get itches. Their anatomy doesn&#39;t allow them to reach over and scratch, so they get creative and use trees, barbwire and what ever else the can find in nature to satisfy that itch. Which can create light to dark scaring on their hides. Lucky for you though, cowboy folklore says the scars on leather hides are good luck and that cowboys would fight over who got to use them. Fortunately you don&#39;t need to fight anyone today for some good luck! The scaring is rare and will not affect the integrity of your wonderful gift.

Heavy Duty Lining and Zipper\r\n4. Timeless Look and Aroma\r\n5. Limited Edition\r\n6. A True Lifetime Warranty \r\n\r\nI am very excited about this new product but if you are unfamiliar with the Horween Leather name, here is a brief overview.\r\n\r\nHorween Leather Company was founded in 1905 by master tanner Isidore Horween. And for more than 100 years their goal has been to make the best leather in the world. They say that making the best means doing lots of little things right. It means never mistaking fastest or cheapest with best. Through the years they have cultivated their experience to offer a dynamic line of leathers that include traditional old world tannages and techniques along with carefully selected updates. Their leathers are still made today, by hand, the same way they were over a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nNot only do these bags look outstanding but the feel and weight will leave you astonished. You may have sudden urges to travel or explore, to roam free, and try new things. If you are already an avid traveler, prepare to fall in love with the world all over again!\r\n\r\nTo me, the best part of these bags are, the more you use them the better they will become and not only will it hold your essentials but they will recall to your mind the memories of past adventures! And there is no better way in my opinion to start the day! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---Measurements---\r\nX-Large Size Only\r\nApprox.10x5x5 Inches\r\n\r\n\r\n---Personalization---\r\nWe personalize the outside for FREE so, please send the initials (first, middle, and last) to be embroidered on your items in the \u201ccomments section\u201d when ordering.

I do not use recycled leather, upholstery leather, or vinyl leather. This stuff is the real deal and comes from a dead animal. The above mentioned leather substitutes are great if you don&#39;t want that amazing leather smell and feel and are ok with an imitation. Because my items come from things that were once alive their hides can have imperfections. Cows like people get itches. Their anatomy doesn&#39;t allow them to reach over and scratch, so they get creative and use trees, barbwire and what ever else the can find in nature to satisfy that itch. Which can create light to dark scaring on their hides. Lucky for you though, cowboy folklore says the scars on leather hides are good luck and that cowboys would fight over who got to use them. Fortunately you don&#39;t need to fight anyone today for some good luck! The scaring is rare and will not affect the integrity of your wonderful gift.

I do not use recycled leather, upholstery leather, or vinyl leather. This stuff is the real deal and comes from a dead animal. The above mentioned leather substitutes are great if you don&#39;t want that amazing leather smell and feel and are ok with an imitation. Because my items come from things that were once alive their hides can have imperfections. Cows like people get itches. Their anatomy doesn&#39;t allow them to reach over and scratch, so they get creative and use trees, barbwire and what ever else the can find in nature to satisfy that itch. Which can create light to dark scaring on their hides. Lucky for you though, cowboy folklore says the scars on leather hides are good luck and that cowboys would fight over who got to use them. Fortunately you don&#39;t need to fight anyone today for some good luck! The scaring is rare and will not affect the integrity of your wonderful gift.

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nLove the look, fantastic quality and function of this bag! Thought it was expensive - but worth it as it will last. I got exactly in the picture plus zipper. The canvas seems very durable and the strap is lovely and soft to touch. Excellent stitching and very solid stud clasp (I thought stuff could fall out but the stud works great, pockets are deep and the bag stays standing up too). So many pockets! I have a place for everything and can find it quickly! I&#39;m using as my handbag which is perfect. Great that I can now fit in extra things like lunch. I thought it could be too big for a handbag and that I might struggle to find little things like my keys - definitely not and the key ring solves that. Did take a few months to arrive which wasn&#39;t a big deal as I knew upfront. Also great communication throughout. Very happy, thanks!\r\n\r\nWow! Absolutely gorgeous construction. I can&#39;t believe it was made by hand. I love the weight of the waxed canvas and  just gorgeous. We will love it long after it stops being our diaper bag. Lightening fast shipping, too! I can&#39;t believe it took just two days to get from France to the west coast. I will be back for more bags. Thanks I love my bag (and my husband says it&#39;s manly enough for him to happily carry too)!!!  It fits everything (nalgene, sweater, planner, phone, wallet, keys) and has perfectly useful pockets and a key lanyard.  Exquisite materials! I love the interior pockets. I am already planning my next purchase!All I can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot; The craftsmanship is beyond compare. I love love love this bag!I highly recommend this item and seller!It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely THE PERFECT diaper bag. I kind of went out on a limb when I decided to order online. I really like to see things in person first, but I was finding no diaper bags I liked. I found cute ones that weren&#39;t functional, or functional ones that certainly weren&#39;t cute. When I saw this one, the design caught my eye. Reading further, I saw there were 10 pockets and loved .Well this bag does not disappoint! It feels sturdy, stands on its own, is cute as a button, and doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a mom carrying around a beast of a diaper bag ;) In fact, I know I love it because I&#39;m already using it and baby&#39;s not here for another month! If you like the look, you&#39;ll love the bag.\r\n\r\nThis bag is amazing! I get compliments on it every time I go out. The pockets are perfect, one side of the bag has larger pockets for keys, checkbooks, etc and the other side is perfect for my cell phone, lip gloss and other smaller items. I do a lot of traveling for work and this is the perfect bag to take with me. It carries all my things and keeps them organized! The workmanship is beautifully done and this is easily my favorite purse. Thank you! \r\n\r\nHere is smaller size another ikabags but how she is happy with pockets for baby needs  !\r\nHere is one lovely customer how she used all pockets for her needs for hers :)\r\n\r\nbottsnet.blogspot.com\/2014\/02\/the-perfect-diaper-bag.html\r\nHi ladies! Finally I&#39;m getting around to reviewing this bag!\r\nI ordered the 10 pocket cross body bag and customized it by adding an 11th zippered pocket. The total (including shipping) ended up being ...$. The shipping is what really made it expensive IMO, but I get it, it&#39;s coming all the way from France! So from the time I ordered it, it took roughly 4 weeks before I got a &quot;it&#39;s shipped!&quot; notification. But once it shipped, it was actually very fast. I got it in 4 days (I&#39;m in CA). This made me glad I didn&#39;t upgrade to express shipping!\r\nNow the bag itself, I really like it! The workmanship is truly exceptional (like I&#39;m the anal kind of person who will scrutinize the seams and make sure they are straight, etc). The bag is exactly how it&#39;s represented in her etsy listing!\r\nThe material is very durable and the leather accents are gorgeous. Very high quality. I love how the bag can stand up on its own with nothing inside! The key fob attachment is a beautiful touch, I keep my keys and my hand sanitizer clipped on it.\r\nThe closure of the bag is just a snap, but honestly I haven&#39;t found any issues with this. If the bag tips over and it&#39;s snapped closed, nothing falls out. Even if the bag is open, the way the opening is angled really keeps everything in!\r\nAt first I was worried that the cross body strap would be uncomfortable if I had tons of stuff in the bag, but I have not found it to be so! I have the strap adjusted to the shortest setting (I&#39;m petite, 5&quot;3) and it&#39;s perfect to wear cross body! I do wish that there was a little loop to hold the excess strap to the main strap. I&#39;ve solved the problem by using a rubber band. When I am using the stroller, the strap does go over the handles and then it&#39;s hands free!\r\nI&#39;ve attached some pictures of the bag and all the stuff I carry in it! I have a 15-almost-16-month-old and I carry:\r\nA changing pad\r\n3-4 diapers\r\nWipes\r\nSunglasses (for the both of us)\r\nSnacks\r\nStraw cup\r\nMy wallet\/wristlets\r\nA notebook\/pen\r\nLO&#39;s dolly and a small book\r\nLip balm, mints, keys, hand sanitizer\r\nThe interior pockets are very useful and help keep the interior nice and tidy. The diapers will fit into one of the pockets. I keep the changing pad, wipes, and my wallet in the zippered pocket because it&#39;s the right shape\/big. Seems to work out well that way!\r\nI am pleased with my purchase, I&#39;ve gotten lots of compliments on it. I like how it doesn&#39;t look like a diaper bag. And I like supporting a small business. \r\n\r\nLove this diaper bag! Good quality all around including hardware! Easy to get into with LOTS of room. Bag is sturdy without being heavy (hard to find!). Shipped fast and Owner even helped out with a special shipping request. Wrapped nicely perfect to send as gift to a new mom! Best part is supporting a small business! THANKS! It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThis bag is exquisite! The french canvas is beautiful quality, the bag is expertly constructed, and the service was super fast! Any hip and trendy mom out there knows how hard it is to find a diaper bag that is both functional and stylish...I have finally found it! I know this bag will last me for years to come - through future babies, and then for my own personal use once we&#39;re beyond the diaper bag phase. Thank you for such a fabulous product! I will tell all my friends, and you can expect I&#39;ll be back for another bag or two in the future. \r\n-------------\r\nMore:\r\nIKABAGS ONLY ONE BOHEMIAN ARTISAN WOMAN !\r\nEco friendly unique

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nDear ikabags,\r\n\r\nWith her background as an artist, my daughter searched very hard for a beautiful,and artsy yet serviceable bag that would hold somewhat of a heavy load. \r\n \r\n Perhaps you have as part of your business objective to bring color and beauty into the mundaneness of everyday life.  Well, I was glad to buy your creation as a birthday gift for my daughter . Thank you so much. \r\n \r\n&quot;The gift you have been given, give as a gift.&quot;  Mathew 10:8(NAB) \r\n S.K\r\n==========\r\nBetween the quality and design of the bag and the amazing responsiveness and personalized attention that she provided, I really don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll ever want to buy handbags from anywhere else! I ordered the bag on Friday night, and within only a couple of hours, I had already received a response from her. Although it was the weekend and I had insisted that she did not need to rush, she had the bag made custom to order and shipped to arrive on Tuesday. The bag looks as beautiful as it appears, and the packaging was beautiful and included the personalized touch of some fresh leaves from Paris. Although many items may appear handmade, this is truly a handmade, personalized bag, and I&#39;m amazed at how much personalized attention and care she is  was able to give to me as a customer but in reading through other comments that were left, I am certainly not surprised at all b\/c my own personal experience echoed the hundreds of others! Thank you ! I have already received several compliments and have been spreading the word! I can&#39;t wait to order more!\r\n======\r\nDear Feyza,\r\nI received my bag last Monday and I&#39;m delighted with it! It worked so well on a trip we took just last week and it works well for daily use as a purse.\r\n\r\nAnd what a surprise when I was sitting in an Iowa airport for our departure home to Washington, DC when the woman sitting next to me had a bag with a bicycle flap - - it was one of your bags! What are the odds that I would meet someone in Iowa (a small predominantly rural state in the MIdwest) that had your fabulous bicycle messenger\/diaper bag! We both commented on how much we love our bags.\r\n\r\nI hope to order again from you in the future. Thank you so much for working with me to customize the bag - it&#39;s perfect! Best wishes ~ J\r\n\r\nI love your bags so much! Mine is like my best friend, great quality and unbelievably tough. I was out in a storm recently and my bag ended up completely drenched on the outside but everything inside was completely dry. So nice to wake up this morning and see you as the featured seller, well deserved!! Rebecca .\r\n\r\nThis is my 5th bag from Feyza (the seller). She is SUPER nice and helpful. The communication with her was an easy and great experience as always. She does her best to customize your needs\/queries, and she responds to your messages fast. The fabric\/texture\/color is absolutely beautiful; and the craftsman is just exquisite. I also love the key clip and  10 pockets inside. I call Feyza an ARTIST because she truly has a talent. I just can&#39;t get enough of her beautiful bags! Thank you, Feyza~ Love your work~ :)\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the picture of this bag at Ikabags, I took my iPad into my closet to see how the bag would work with my summer clothes. It&#39;s as if the designer in Paris had been able to look into my closet in Colorado and see exactly what I needed! It&#39;s perfect!! And I had no idea that turquoise is stunning with all the colors I wear! The shape of the bag and the texture of the fabric are so sophisticated. I absolutely adore this bag!! Chicest summer purse I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;m charmed by the surprise of three different fabrics on the inside. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI was looking for the perfect school bag and wasn&#39;t expecting how truly perfect this would be! It&#39;s not only handmade in Paris, France (a place I&#39;ve been preparing to visit since I was a child) by a wonderful woman with love and precision - it&#39;s so fashionable and functional at the same time! I waited only one weekend and it crossed the Atlantic and straight to Ventura County, Southern California! Packaged beautifully with ribbon and all! It&#39;s also very sturdy and can hold my big binder, a book and my laptop. My boyfriend and I loved it so much (he has an eye for beautiful things) we went out and bought a heavy weight fabric that looked the same as the interior (the Ecru color), he sewed a foam backing to the fabric and created a pen\/pencil case!!! That way, no ink or pencil marks can dirty the bag! Creative, a pleasure to talk to and talented - this shop owner is just amazing. I know where I&#39;m getting my bags from now on ;) \r\n\r\n    This is crazy. I order something from ikabags; and it makes it from Paris to Cleveland in like two days! I can&#39;t get a delivery that fast from Indiana! :) The last bag (a Mimosa) that I got from Ikabags was a smash hit as my wife&#39;s birthday present. She&#39;s been carrying it every day. It&#39;s beautifully made; elegant and sturdy. And roomy. She loves it. I&#39;m giving her this one as an end-of-the-school-year gift. It came so beautifully wrapped, that I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll have to wait until my wife opens it to actually see the bag. I don&#39;t want to spoil the gift-wrapping. I have absolutely no doubt that it will be as fine as the last one we bought. BTW... This one was custom made and out the door of her shop in about two days. Thank you!\r\n\r\n     When I emailed that the bag was a gift for my daughter in law and there were time constraints I received an immediate telephone call from France from the designer, reassuring me that the bag would be shipped that day. I received it, in New York City, the very next day. It arrived beautifully wrapped and ready to go. My daughter in law, a fashion and beauty editor, specifically requested it, so I know it will be well used. In this age of internet big box outlets and impersonal ordering, it&#39;s a pleasure to deal directly with people who care. Laura Adams New York\r\n\r\n     I am in love with this bag for so many reasons: 1. I finally have a bag that can hold all of my things without being too bulky. The well-thought-out interior pockets are of varying sizes and, even when they are all filled, there is still enough room in the middle of the bag for my large water bottle! 2. The fabric is gorgeous and unique, and I love the soft adjustable strap. Photos don&#39;t do the fabric justice! 3. The construction is impeccable and professional. 4. It was shipped so quickly... from France to MA in just a few days! I don&#39;t see myself carrying another bag ever again. Thanks for the beautiful unique product!\r\n\r\nThis transaction didn&#39;t go at ALL as I was expecting. It was 100% better! I ordered the bag on Monday evening, and it came to me on Thursday morning! Not bad coming to Canada from France! Communication was excellent. The bag is beyond beautiful! I was not expecting the material to feel so soft! Each little detail is so beautifully done! Each inner pocket fits everything I needed a pocket for! This is the most expensive purse I have ever purchased, and I would do it again in a heartbeat! In fact, I will do it again! :) Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMerci beaucoup !\r\nAll designs and Content \u00a9 2007-2015 ikabags\u2122 All rights reserved.\r\nReturn to shop: \r\nikabags.etsy.com","currency_code":"EUR","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"BONJOUR  NICIES !\r\n\r\nSHOP IS OPEN BUT I WILL AWAY FOR  MOVING NEWHOME -ATELIER 22 JAN-4 FEB 2015.\r\nBIG THANKS for your interest and for supporting my handmade work !\r\nI&#39;ve worked so hard to build. \r\n\r\n The things HANDMADE that you do need should be simple, elegant, functional, durable and beautiful.\r\nBEWARE OF IMITATIONS , THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HANDMADE ;ARTISANMADE STORE !\r\nMade from start to finish in PARIS,FRANCE\r\nTHANKS FOR BUY GOOD THINGS FROM REAL PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING ADDRESS  :\r\n* Please note that you can now view &quot;scheduled to ship by dates&quot; right on your invoice (which you can find in &quot;your account&quot; and &quot;purchases&quot;). \r\nI am trying sewing faster in humanly possibility .But please don&#39;t forget SINCE 2007 I am only ONE WOMAN working with you , working for you and yours !\r\nThank you in advance for your patience. \r\n\r\nThis note already was at Ikabags Shop Announce , at shipping details when you click before order , at policy, at profile,so i write at every where at my handmade shop  !

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nLove the look, fantastic quality and function of this bag! Thought it was expensive - but worth it as it will last. I got exactly in the picture plus zipper. The canvas seems very durable and the strap is lovely and soft to touch. Excellent stitching and very solid stud clasp (I thought stuff could fall out but the stud works great, pockets are deep and the bag stays standing up too). So many pockets! I have a place for everything and can find it quickly! I&#39;m using as my handbag which is perfect. Great that I can now fit in extra things like lunch. I thought it could be too big for a handbag and that I might struggle to find little things like my keys - definitely not and the key ring solves that. Did take a few months to arrive which wasn&#39;t a big deal as I knew upfront. Also great communication throughout. Very happy, thanks!\r\n\r\nFabulous !!! It was exactly as described. Lovely cozy bag not a stitch or thread out of place! Using it for everyday, comfortably fits everything you need (and more!). Love the way it stands upright, especially when you&#39;re looking through it because you forgot which pocket your sunnies are in! lol Pockets are great, everything is divided up, so you aren&#39;t picking though all your items. I chose the orange strap, it adds a lovely edge to the dark khaki. Already planning the next one, will make the ultimate gift.\r\nThe quality cannot be found in stores.\r\nJust what I always wanted. Beautifully made, excellent material. I was prepared for a long waiting time, so that was okay with me as I expect to use this bag for a long time. However, this bag is amazing.  It looks and feel very durable and I love that it stands up on its own and doesn&#39;t slouch. I am very pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is smaller size another ikabags but how she is happy with pockets for baby needs  !\r\nHere is one lovely customer how she used all pockets for her needs for hers :)\r\n\r\nbottsnet.blogspot.com\/2014\/02\/the-perfect-diaper-bag.html\r\nHi ladies! Finally I&#39;m getting around to reviewing this bag!\r\nI ordered the 10 pocket cross body bag and customized it by adding an 11th zippered pocket. The total (including shipping) ended up being ...$. The shipping is what really made it expensive IMO, but I get it, it&#39;s coming all the way from France! So from the time I ordered it, it took roughly 4 weeks before I got a &quot;it&#39;s shipped!&quot; notification. But once it shipped, it was actually very fast. I got it in 4 days (I&#39;m in CA). This made me glad I didn&#39;t upgrade to express shipping!\r\nNow the bag itself, I really like it! The workmanship is truly exceptional (like I&#39;m the anal kind of person who will scrutinize the seams and make sure they are straight, etc). The bag is exactly how it&#39;s represented in her etsy listing!\r\nThe material is very durable and the leather accents are gorgeous. Very high quality. I love how the bag can stand up on its own with nothing inside! The key fob attachment is a beautiful touch, I keep my keys and my hand sanitizer clipped on it.\r\nThe closure of the bag is just a snap, but honestly I haven&#39;t found any issues with this. If the bag tips over and it&#39;s snapped closed, nothing falls out. Even if the bag is open, the way the opening is angled really keeps everything in!\r\nAt first I was worried that the cross body strap would be uncomfortable if I had tons of stuff in the bag, but I have not found it to be so! I have the strap adjusted to the shortest setting (I&#39;m petite, 5&quot;3) and it&#39;s perfect to wear cross body! I do wish that there was a little loop to hold the excess strap to the main strap. I&#39;ve solved the problem by using a rubber band. When I am using the stroller, the strap does go over the handles and then it&#39;s hands free!\r\nI&#39;ve attached some pictures of the bag and all the stuff I carry in it! I have a 15-almost-16-month-old and I carry:\r\nA changing pad\r\n3-4 diapers\r\nWipes\r\nSunglasses (for the both of us)\r\nSnacks\r\nStraw cup\r\nMy wallet\/wristlets\r\nA notebook\/pen\r\nLO&#39;s dolly and a small book\r\nLip balm, mints, keys, hand sanitizer\r\nThe interior pockets are very useful and help keep the interior nice and tidy. The diapers will fit into one of the pockets. I keep the changing pad, wipes, and my wallet in the zippered pocket because it&#39;s the right shape\/big. Seems to work out well that way!\r\nI am pleased with my purchase, I&#39;ve gotten lots of compliments on it. I like how it doesn&#39;t look like a diaper bag. And I like supporting a small business. \r\n\r\n\r\nWow! Absolutely gorgeous construction. I can&#39;t believe it was made by hand. I love the weight of the waxed canvas and  just gorgeous. We will love it long after it stops being our diaper bag. Lightening fast shipping, too! I can&#39;t believe it took just two days to get from France to the west coast. I will be back for more bags. Thanks I love my bag (and my husband says it&#39;s manly enough for him to happily carry too)!!!  It fits everything (nalgene, sweater, planner, phone, wallet, keys) and has perfectly useful pockets and a key lanyard.  Exquisite materials! I love the interior pockets. I am already planning my next purchase!All I can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot; The craftsmanship is beyond compare. I love love love this bag!I highly recommend this item and seller!It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThe bag arrived in perfect condition and it is wonderful! I had so much fun opening the box and enjoying the charming packaging. The bag itself is exquisite - beautifully made, intelligently designed, gorgeous fabrics, perfect details. It is a joy to carry it, and it means so much to me that it was handmade by you. I will treasure it for years to come. Thank you!\r\nI have to say that I love the bag even more since I&#39;ve been using it. It is remarkably sturdy yet very chic at the same time. It is such a pleasure to carry it and I know that I will use if for many, many years. \r\n\r\nThis is absolutely THE PERFECT diaper bag. I kind of went out on a limb when I decided to order online. I really like to see things in person first, but I was finding no diaper bags I liked. I found cute ones that weren&#39;t functional, or functional ones that certainly weren&#39;t cute. When I saw this one, the design caught my eye. Reading further, I saw there were 10 pockets and loved .Well this bag does not disappoint! It feels sturdy, stands on its own, is cute as a button, and doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a mom carrying around a beast of a diaper bag ;) In fact, I know I love it because I&#39;m already using it and baby&#39;s not here for another month! If you like the look, you&#39;ll love the bag.\r\n\r\nThis bag is amazing! I get compliments on it every time I go out. The pockets are perfect, one side of the bag has larger pockets for keys, checkbooks, etc and the other side is perfect for my cell phone, lip gloss and other smaller items. I do a lot of traveling for work and this is the perfect bag to take with me. It carries all my things and keeps them organized! The workmanship is beautifully done and this is easily my favorite purse. Thank you! \r\nLove this diaper bag! Good quality all around including hardware! Easy to get into with LOTS of room. Bag is sturdy without being heavy (hard to find!). Shipped fast and Owner even helped out with a special shipping request. Wrapped nicely perfect to send as gift to a new mom! Best part is supporting a small business! THANKS! It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThis bag is exquisite! The french canvas is beautiful quality, the bag is expertly constructed, and the service was super fast! Any hip and trendy mom out there knows how hard it is to find a diaper bag that is both functional and stylish...I have finally found it! I know this bag will last me for years to come - through future babies, and then for my own personal use once we&#39;re beyond the diaper bag phase. Thank you for such a fabulous product! I will tell all my friends, and you can expect I&#39;ll be back for another bag or two in the future.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nMore:\r\nIKABAGS ONLY ONE BOHEMIAN ARTISAN WOMAN !\r\nEco

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nDear ikabags,\r\n\r\nWith her background as an artist, my daughter searched very hard for a beautiful,and artsy yet serviceable bag that would hold somewhat of a heavy load. \r\n \r\n Perhaps you have as part of your business objective to bring color and beauty into the mundaneness of everyday life.  Well, I was glad to buy your creation as a birthday gift for my daughter . Thank you so much. \r\n \r\n&quot;The gift you have been given, give as a gift.&quot;  Mathew 10:8(NAB) \r\n S.K\r\n==========\r\nBetween the quality and design of the bag and the amazing responsiveness and personalized attention that she provided, I really don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll ever want to buy handbags from anywhere else! I ordered the bag on Friday night, and within only a couple of hours, I had already received a response from her. Although it was the weekend and I had insisted that she did not need to rush, she had the bag made custom to order and shipped to arrive on Tuesday. The bag looks as beautiful as it appears, and the packaging was beautiful and included the personalized touch of some fresh leaves from Paris. Although many items may appear handmade, this is truly a handmade, personalized bag, and I&#39;m amazed at how much personalized attention and care she is  was able to give to me as a customer but in reading through other comments that were left, I am certainly not surprised at all b\/c my own personal experience echoed the hundreds of others! Thank you ! I have already received several compliments and have been spreading the word! I can&#39;t wait to order more!\r\n======\r\nDear Feyza,\r\nI received my bag last Monday and I&#39;m delighted with it! It worked so well on a trip we took just last week and it works well for daily use as a purse.\r\n\r\nAnd what a surprise when I was sitting in an Iowa airport for our departure home to Washington, DC when the woman sitting next to me had a bag with a bicycle flap - - it was one of your bags! What are the odds that I would meet someone in Iowa (a small predominantly rural state in the MIdwest) that had your fabulous bicycle messenger\/diaper bag! We both commented on how much we love our bags.\r\n\r\nI hope to order again from you in the future. Thank you so much for working with me to customize the bag - it&#39;s perfect! Best wishes ~ J\r\n\r\nI love your bags so much! Mine is like my best friend, great quality and unbelievably tough. I was out in a storm recently and my bag ended up completely drenched on the outside but everything inside was completely dry. So nice to wake up this morning and see you as the featured seller, well deserved!! Rebecca .\r\n\r\nThis is my 5th bag from Feyza (the seller). She is SUPER nice and helpful. The communication with her was an easy and great experience as always. She does her best to customize your needs\/queries, and she responds to your messages fast. The fabric\/texture\/color is absolutely beautiful; and the craftsman is just exquisite. I also love the key clip and  10 pockets inside. I call Feyza an ARTIST because she truly has a talent. I just can&#39;t get enough of her beautiful bags! Thank you, Feyza~ Love your work~ :)\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the picture of this bag at Ikabags, I took my iPad into my closet to see how the bag would work with my summer clothes. It&#39;s as if the designer in Paris had been able to look into my closet in Colorado and see exactly what I needed! It&#39;s perfect!! And I had no idea that turquoise is stunning with all the colors I wear! The shape of the bag and the texture of the fabric are so sophisticated. I absolutely adore this bag!! Chicest summer purse I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;m charmed by the surprise of three different fabrics on the inside. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI was looking for the perfect school bag and wasn&#39;t expecting how truly perfect this would be! It&#39;s not only handmade in Paris, France (a place I&#39;ve been preparing to visit since I was a child) by a wonderful woman with love and precision - it&#39;s so fashionable and functional at the same time! I waited only one weekend and it crossed the Atlantic and straight to Ventura County, Southern California! Packaged beautifully with ribbon and all! It&#39;s also very sturdy and can hold my big binder, a book and my laptop. My boyfriend and I loved it so much (he has an eye for beautiful things) we went out and bought a heavy weight fabric that looked the same as the interior (the Ecru color), he sewed a foam backing to the fabric and created a pen\/pencil case!!! That way, no ink or pencil marks can dirty the bag! Creative, a pleasure to talk to and talented - this shop owner is just amazing. I know where I&#39;m getting my bags from now on ;) \r\n\r\n    This is crazy. I order something from ikabags; and it makes it from Paris to Cleveland in like two days! I can&#39;t get a delivery that fast from Indiana! :) The last bag (a Mimosa) that I got from Ikabags was a smash hit as my wife&#39;s birthday present. She&#39;s been carrying it every day. It&#39;s beautifully made; elegant and sturdy. And roomy. She loves it. I&#39;m giving her this one as an end-of-the-school-year gift. It came so beautifully wrapped, that I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll have to wait until my wife opens it to actually see the bag. I don&#39;t want to spoil the gift-wrapping. I have absolutely no doubt that it will be as fine as the last one we bought. BTW... This one was custom made and out the door of her shop in about two days. Thank you!\r\n\r\n     When I emailed that the bag was a gift for my daughter in law and there were time constraints I received an immediate telephone call from France from the designer, reassuring me that the bag would be shipped that day. I received it, in New York City, the very next day. It arrived beautifully wrapped and ready to go. My daughter in law, a fashion and beauty editor, specifically requested it, so I know it will be well used. In this age of internet big box outlets and impersonal ordering, it&#39;s a pleasure to deal directly with people who care. Laura Adams New York\r\n\r\n     I am in love with this bag for so many reasons: 1. I finally have a bag that can hold all of my things without being too bulky. The well-thought-out interior pockets are of varying sizes and, even when they are all filled, there is still enough room in the middle of the bag for my large water bottle! 2. The fabric is gorgeous and unique, and I love the soft adjustable strap. Photos don&#39;t do the fabric justice! 3. The construction is impeccable and professional. 4. It was shipped so quickly... from France to MA in just a few days! I don&#39;t see myself carrying another bag ever again. Thanks for the beautiful unique product!\r\n\r\nThis transaction didn&#39;t go at ALL as I was expecting. It was 100% better! I ordered the bag on Monday evening, and it came to me on Thursday morning! Not bad coming to Canada from France! Communication was excellent. The bag is beyond beautiful! I was not expecting the material to feel so soft! Each little detail is so beautifully done! Each inner pocket fits everything I needed a pocket for! This is the most expensive purse I have ever purchased, and I would do it again in a heartbeat! In fact, I will do it again! :) Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMerci beaucoup !\r\nAll designs and Content \u00a9 2007-2015 ikabags\u2122 All rights reserved.\r\nReturn to shop: \r\nikabags.etsy.com","currency_code":"EUR","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"BONJOUR  NICIES !\r\n\r\nSHOP IS OPEN BUT I WILL AWAY FOR  MOVING NEWHOME -ATELIER 22 JAN-4 FEB 2015.\r\nBIG THANKS for your interest and for supporting my handmade work !\r\nI&#39;ve worked so hard to build. \r\n\r\n The things HANDMADE that you do need should be simple, elegant, functional, durable and beautiful.\r\nBEWARE OF IMITATIONS , THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HANDMADE ;ARTISANMADE STORE !\r\nMade from start to finish in PARIS,FRANCE\r\nTHANKS FOR BUY GOOD THINGS FROM REAL PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING ADDRESS  :\r\n* Please note that you can now view &quot;scheduled to ship by dates&quot; right on your invoice (which you can find in &quot;your account&quot; and &quot;purchases&quot;). \r\nI am trying sewing faster in humanly possibility .But please don&#39;t forget SINCE 2007 I am only ONE WOMAN working with you , working for you and yours !\r\nThank you in advance for your patience. \r\n\r\nThis note already was at Ikabags Shop Announce , at shipping details when you click before order , at policy, at profile,so i write at every where at my handmade shop  !

The way that it&#39;s made is just beautiful. And I love how the seller packaged it with such care and wrapped it like a gift. I use it for school as stated before. It&#39;s prefect because it&#39;s so durable. The stitching is done beautifully, and the quality is amazing. You can see the quality in the materials used in it also. It holds up on the weight I throw in it. I just love that no one else has the same bag as I do. I think it would be a great school bag or bag to throw all your stuff in for work. It&#39;s very, very well made. I love everything about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish messenger bag or tote bag of large purse or alternative to a backpack.I had to wait a couple of weeks to leave my review. The bag came sooner than promised! It&#39;s really awesome. I use it as a messenger bag for nursing school. I was hoping the handles would be slightly longer, maybe about an inch but it still fits on my shoulder if I carry it on my shoulder by the handles. But I got the white strap and have been carrying it that way a lot. I love the bag. It&#39;s beautiful and beautifly made. The compartments are awesome. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re the depth they are they perfectly fit my phone and other things I need for school. Most of my books are eBooks so I&#39;m able to fit my iPad mini, a text book, my binder, 2 tablets and my MacBook Air all in there and still have room or the compartments for my pencile pouch and other odds and ends. I paid extra for the zipper pocket. I really love it.\r\n\r\nHi Feyza,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for showing us your work last week. It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nLove the look, fantastic quality and function of this bag! Thought it was expensive - but worth it as it will last. I got exactly in the picture plus zipper. The canvas seems very durable and the strap is lovely and soft to touch. Excellent stitching and very solid stud clasp (I thought stuff could fall out but the stud works great, pockets are deep and the bag stays standing up too). So many pockets! I have a place for everything and can find it quickly! I&#39;m using as my handbag which is perfect. Great that I can now fit in extra things like lunch. I thought it could be too big for a handbag and that I might struggle to find little things like my keys - definitely not and the key ring solves that. Did take a few months to arrive which wasn&#39;t a big deal as I knew upfront. Also great communication throughout. Very happy, thanks!\r\n\r\nThis bag is amazing! I get compliments on it every time I go out. The pockets are perfect, one side of the bag has larger pockets for keys, checkbooks, etc and the other side is perfect for my cell phone, lip gloss and other smaller items. I do a lot of traveling for work and this is the perfect bag to take with me. It carries all my things and keeps them organized! The workmanship is beautifully done and this is easily my favorite purse. Thank you! \r\nLove this diaper bag! Good quality all around including hardware! Easy to get into with LOTS of room. Bag is sturdy without being heavy (hard to find!). Shipped fast and Owner even helped out with a special shipping request. Wrapped nicely perfect to send as gift to a new mom! Best part is supporting a small business! THANKS! It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nHere is smaller size another ikabags but how she is happy with pockets for baby needs !\r\nHere is one lovely customer how she used all pockets for her needs for hers :)\r\n\r\nbottsnet.blogspot.com\/2014\/02\/the-perfect-diaper-bag.html\r\nHi ladies! Finally I&#39;m getting around to reviewing this bag!\r\nI ordered the 10 pocket cross body bag and customized it by adding an 11th zippered pocket. The total (including shipping) ended up being ...$. The shipping is what really made it expensive IMO, but I get it, it&#39;s coming all the way from France! So from the time I ordered it, it took roughly 4 weeks before I got a &quot;it&#39;s shipped!&quot; notification. But once it shipped, it was actually very fast. I got it in 4 days (I&#39;m in CA). This made me glad I didn&#39;t upgrade to express shipping!\r\nNow the bag itself, I really like it! The workmanship is truly exceptional (like I&#39;m the anal kind of person who will scrutinize the seams and make sure they are straight, etc). The bag is exactly how it&#39;s represented in her etsy listing!\r\nThe material is very durable and the leather accents are gorgeous. Very high quality. I love how the bag can stand up on its own with nothing inside! The key fob attachment is a beautiful touch, I keep my keys and my hand sanitizer clipped on it.\r\nThe closure of the bag is just a snap, but honestly I haven&#39;t found any issues with this. If the bag tips over and it&#39;s snapped closed, nothing falls out. Even if the bag is open, the way the opening is angled really keeps everything in!\r\nAt first I was worried that the cross body strap would be uncomfortable if I had tons of stuff in the bag, but I have not found it to be so! I have the strap adjusted to the shortest setting (I&#39;m petite, 5&quot;3) and it&#39;s perfect to wear cross body! I do wish that there was a little loop to hold the excess strap to the main strap. I&#39;ve solved the problem by using a rubber band. When I am using the stroller, the strap does go over the handles and then it&#39;s hands free!\r\nI&#39;ve attached some pictures of the bag and all the stuff I carry in it! I have a 15-almost-16-month-old and I carry:\r\nA changing pad\r\n3-4 diapers\r\nWipes\r\nSunglasses (for the both of us)\r\nSnacks\r\nStraw cup\r\nMy wallet\/wristlets\r\nA notebook\/pen\r\nLO&#39;s dolly and a small book\r\nLip balm, mints, keys, hand sanitizer\r\nThe interior pockets are very useful and help keep the interior nice and tidy. The diapers will fit into one of the pockets. I keep the changing pad, wipes, and my wallet in the zippered pocket because it&#39;s the right shape\/big. Seems to work out well that way!\r\nI am pleased with my purchase, I&#39;ve gotten lots of compliments on it. I like how it doesn&#39;t look like a diaper bag. And I like supporting a small business. \r\n\r\nWow! Absolutely gorgeous construction. I can&#39;t believe it was made by hand. I love the weight of the waxed canvas and just gorgeous. We will love it long after it stops being our diaper bag. Lightening fast shipping, too! I can&#39;t believe it took just two days to get from France to the west coast. I will be back for more bags. Thanks I love my bag (and my husband says it&#39;s manly enough for him to happily carry too)!!! It fits everything (nalgene, sweater, planner, phone, wallet, keys) and has perfectly useful pockets and a key lanyard. Exquisite materials! I love the interior pockets. I am already planning my next purchase!All I can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot; The craftsmanship is beyond compare. I love love love this bag!I highly recommend this item and seller!It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThe bag arrived in perfect condition and it is wonderful! I had so much fun opening the box and enjoying the charming packaging. The bag itself is exquisite - beautifully made, intelligently designed, gorgeous fabrics, perfect details. It is a joy to carry it, and it means so much to me that it was handmade by you. I will treasure it for years to come. Thank you!\r\nI have to say that I love the bag even more since I&#39;ve been using it. It is remarkably sturdy yet very chic at the same time. It is such a pleasure to carry it and I know that I will use if for many, many years. \r\n\r\nThis is absolutely THE PERFECT diaper bag. I kind of went out on a limb when I decided to order online. I really like to see things in person first, but I was finding no diaper bags I liked. I found cute ones that weren&#39;t functional, or functional ones that certainly weren&#39;t cute. When I saw this one, the design caught my eye. Reading further, I saw there were 10 pockets and loved .Well this bag does not disappoint! It feels sturdy, stands on its own, is cute as a button, and doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a mom carrying around a beast of a diaper bag ;) In fact, I know I love it because I&#39;m already using it and baby&#39;s not here for another month! If you like the look, you&#39;ll love the bag.\r\n\r\nThis bag is exquisite! The french canvas is beautiful quality, the bag is expertly constructed, and the service was super fast! Any hip and trendy mom out there knows how hard it is to find a diaper bag that is both functional and stylish...I have finally found it! I know this bag will last me for years to come - through future babies, and then for my own personal use once we&#39;re beyond the diaper bag phase. Thank you for such a fabulous product! I will tell all my friends, and you can expect I&#39;ll be back for another bag or two in the future.\r\n\r\nMore:\r\nIKABAGS ONLY ONE BOHEMIAN ARTISAN WOMAN !\r\nEco friendly unique bags are

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nDear ikabags,\r\n\r\nWith her background as an artist, my daughter searched very hard for a beautiful,and artsy yet serviceable bag that would hold somewhat of a heavy load. \r\n \r\n Perhaps you have as part of your business objective to bring color and beauty into the mundaneness of everyday life.  Well, I was glad to buy your creation as a birthday gift for my daughter . Thank you so much. \r\n \r\n&quot;The gift you have been given, give as a gift.&quot;  Mathew 10:8(NAB) \r\n S.K\r\n==========\r\nBetween the quality and design of the bag and the amazing responsiveness and personalized attention that she provided, I really don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll ever want to buy handbags from anywhere else! I ordered the bag on Friday night, and within only a couple of hours, I had already received a response from her. Although it was the weekend and I had insisted that she did not need to rush, she had the bag made custom to order and shipped to arrive on Tuesday. The bag looks as beautiful as it appears, and the packaging was beautiful and included the personalized touch of some fresh leaves from Paris. Although many items may appear handmade, this is truly a handmade, personalized bag, and I&#39;m amazed at how much personalized attention and care she is  was able to give to me as a customer but in reading through other comments that were left, I am certainly not surprised at all b\/c my own personal experience echoed the hundreds of others! Thank you ! I have already received several compliments and have been spreading the word! I can&#39;t wait to order more!\r\n======\r\nDear Feyza,\r\nI received my bag last Monday and I&#39;m delighted with it! It worked so well on a trip we took just last week and it works well for daily use as a purse.\r\n\r\nAnd what a surprise when I was sitting in an Iowa airport for our departure home to Washington, DC when the woman sitting next to me had a bag with a bicycle flap - - it was one of your bags! What are the odds that I would meet someone in Iowa (a small predominantly rural state in the MIdwest) that had your fabulous bicycle messenger\/diaper bag! We both commented on how much we love our bags.\r\n\r\nI hope to order again from you in the future. Thank you so much for working with me to customize the bag - it&#39;s perfect! Best wishes ~ J\r\n\r\nI love your bags so much! Mine is like my best friend, great quality and unbelievably tough. I was out in a storm recently and my bag ended up completely drenched on the outside but everything inside was completely dry. So nice to wake up this morning and see you as the featured seller, well deserved!! Rebecca .\r\n\r\nThis is my 5th bag from Feyza (the seller). She is SUPER nice and helpful. The communication with her was an easy and great experience as always. She does her best to customize your needs\/queries, and she responds to your messages fast. The fabric\/texture\/color is absolutely beautiful; and the craftsman is just exquisite. I also love the key clip and  10 pockets inside. I call Feyza an ARTIST because she truly has a talent. I just can&#39;t get enough of her beautiful bags! Thank you, Feyza~ Love your work~ :)\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the picture of this bag at Ikabags, I took my iPad into my closet to see how the bag would work with my summer clothes. It&#39;s as if the designer in Paris had been able to look into my closet in Colorado and see exactly what I needed! It&#39;s perfect!! And I had no idea that turquoise is stunning with all the colors I wear! The shape of the bag and the texture of the fabric are so sophisticated. I absolutely adore this bag!! Chicest summer purse I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;m charmed by the surprise of three different fabrics on the inside. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI was looking for the perfect school bag and wasn&#39;t expecting how truly perfect this would be! It&#39;s not only handmade in Paris, France (a place I&#39;ve been preparing to visit since I was a child) by a wonderful woman with love and precision - it&#39;s so fashionable and functional at the same time! I waited only one weekend and it crossed the Atlantic and straight to Ventura County, Southern California! Packaged beautifully with ribbon and all! It&#39;s also very sturdy and can hold my big binder, a book and my laptop. My boyfriend and I loved it so much (he has an eye for beautiful things) we went out and bought a heavy weight fabric that looked the same as the interior (the Ecru color), he sewed a foam backing to the fabric and created a pen\/pencil case!!! That way, no ink or pencil marks can dirty the bag! Creative, a pleasure to talk to and talented - this shop owner is just amazing. I know where I&#39;m getting my bags from now on ;) \r\n\r\n    This is crazy. I order something from ikabags; and it makes it from Paris to Cleveland in like two days! I can&#39;t get a delivery that fast from Indiana! :) The last bag (a Mimosa) that I got from Ikabags was a smash hit as my wife&#39;s birthday present. She&#39;s been carrying it every day. It&#39;s beautifully made; elegant and sturdy. And roomy. She loves it. I&#39;m giving her this one as an end-of-the-school-year gift. It came so beautifully wrapped, that I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll have to wait until my wife opens it to actually see the bag. I don&#39;t want to spoil the gift-wrapping. I have absolutely no doubt that it will be as fine as the last one we bought. BTW... This one was custom made and out the door of her shop in about two days. Thank you!\r\n\r\n     When I emailed that the bag was a gift for my daughter in law and there were time constraints I received an immediate telephone call from France from the designer, reassuring me that the bag would be shipped that day. I received it, in New York City, the very next day. It arrived beautifully wrapped and ready to go. My daughter in law, a fashion and beauty editor, specifically requested it, so I know it will be well used. In this age of internet big box outlets and impersonal ordering, it&#39;s a pleasure to deal directly with people who care. Laura Adams New York\r\n\r\n     I am in love with this bag for so many reasons: 1. I finally have a bag that can hold all of my things without being too bulky. The well-thought-out interior pockets are of varying sizes and, even when they are all filled, there is still enough room in the middle of the bag for my large water bottle! 2. The fabric is gorgeous and unique, and I love the soft adjustable strap. Photos don&#39;t do the fabric justice! 3. The construction is impeccable and professional. 4. It was shipped so quickly... from France to MA in just a few days! I don&#39;t see myself carrying another bag ever again. Thanks for the beautiful unique product!\r\n\r\nThis transaction didn&#39;t go at ALL as I was expecting. It was 100% better! I ordered the bag on Monday evening, and it came to me on Thursday morning! Not bad coming to Canada from France! Communication was excellent. The bag is beyond beautiful! I was not expecting the material to feel so soft! Each little detail is so beautifully done! Each inner pocket fits everything I needed a pocket for!

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nLove the look, fantastic quality and function of this bag! Thought it was expensive - but worth it as it will last. I got exactly in the picture plus zipper. The canvas seems very durable and the strap is lovely and soft to touch. Excellent stitching and very solid stud clasp (I thought stuff could fall out but the stud works great, pockets are deep and the bag stays standing up too). So many pockets! I have a place for everything and can find it quickly! I&#39;m using as my handbag which is perfect. Great that I can now fit in extra things like lunch. I thought it could be too big for a handbag and that I might struggle to find little things like my keys - definitely not and the key ring solves that. Did take a few months to arrive which wasn&#39;t a big deal as I knew upfront. Also great communication throughout. Very happy, thanks!\r\n\r\nThis bag can be used for way more than a diaper bag. The way that it&#39;s made is just beautiful. And I love how the seller packaged it with such care and wrapped it like a gift. I use it for school as stated before. It&#39;s prefect because it&#39;s so durable. The stitching is done beautifully, and the quality is amazing. You can see the quality in the materials used in it also. It holds up on the weight I throw in it. I just love that no one else has the same bag as I do. I think it would be a great school bag or bag to throw all your stuff in for work. It&#39;s very, very well made. I love everything about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish messenger bag or tote bag of large purse or alternative to a backpack.I had to wait a couple of weeks to leave my review. The bag came sooner than promised! It&#39;s really awesome. I use it as a messenger bag for nursing school. I was hoping the handles would be slightly longer, maybe about an inch but it still fits on my shoulder if I carry it on my shoulder by the handles. But I got the white strap and have been carrying it that way a lot. I love the bag. It&#39;s beautiful and beautifly made. The compartments are awesome. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re the depth they are they perfectly fit my phone and other things I need for school. Most of my books are eBooks so I&#39;m able to fit my iPad mini, a text book, my binder, 2 tablets and my MacBook Air all in there and still have room or the compartments for my pencile pouch and other odds and ends. I paid extra for the zipper pocket. I really love it.\r\n\r\nHere is smaller size another ikabags but how she is happy with pockets for baby needs  !\r\nHere is one lovely customer how she used all pockets for her needs for hers :)\r\n\r\nbottsnet.blogspot.com\/2014\/02\/the-perfect-diaper-bag.html\r\nHi ladies! Finally I&#39;m getting around to reviewing this bag!\r\nI ordered the 10 pocket cross body bag and customized it by adding an 11th zippered pocket. The total (including shipping) ended up being ...$. The shipping is what really made it expensive IMO, but I get it, it&#39;s coming all the way from France! So from the time I ordered it, it took roughly 4 weeks before I got a &quot;it&#39;s shipped!&quot; notification. But once it shipped, it was actually very fast. I got it in 4 days (I&#39;m in CA). This made me glad I didn&#39;t upgrade to express shipping!\r\nNow the bag itself, I really like it! The workmanship is truly exceptional (like I&#39;m the anal kind of person who will scrutinize the seams and make sure they are straight, etc). The bag is exactly how it&#39;s represented in her etsy listing!\r\nThe material is very durable and the leather accents are gorgeous. Very high quality. I love how the bag can stand up on its own with nothing inside! The key fob attachment is a beautiful touch, I keep my keys and my hand sanitizer clipped on it.\r\nThe closure of the bag is just a snap, but honestly I haven&#39;t found any issues with this. If the bag tips over and it&#39;s snapped closed, nothing falls out. Even if the bag is open, the way the opening is angled really keeps everything in!\r\nAt first I was worried that the cross body strap would be uncomfortable if I had tons of stuff in the bag, but I have not found it to be so! I have the strap adjusted to the shortest setting (I&#39;m petite, 5&quot;3) and it&#39;s perfect to wear cross body! I do wish that there was a little loop to hold the excess strap to the main strap. I&#39;ve solved the problem by using a rubber band. When I am using the stroller, the strap does go over the handles and then it&#39;s hands free!\r\nI&#39;ve attached some pictures of the bag and all the stuff I carry in it! I have a 15-almost-16-month-old and I carry:\r\nA changing pad\r\n3-4 diapers\r\nWipes\r\nSunglasses (for the both of us)\r\nSnacks\r\nStraw cup\r\nMy wallet\/wristlets\r\nA notebook\/pen\r\nLO&#39;s dolly and a small book\r\nLip balm, mints, keys, hand sanitizer\r\nThe interior pockets are very useful and help keep the interior nice and tidy. The diapers will fit into one of the pockets. I keep the changing pad, wipes, and my wallet in the zippered pocket because it&#39;s the right shape\/big. Seems to work out well that way!\r\nI am pleased with my purchase, I&#39;ve gotten lots of compliments on it. I like how it doesn&#39;t look like a diaper bag. And I like supporting a small business. \r\n\r\nWow! Absolutely gorgeous construction. I can&#39;t believe it was made by hand. I love the weight of the waxed canvas and  just gorgeous. We will love it long after it stops being our diaper bag. Lightening fast shipping, too! I can&#39;t believe it took just two days to get from France to the west coast. I will be back for more bags. Thanks I love my bag (and my husband says it&#39;s manly enough for him to happily carry too)!!!  It fits everything (nalgene, sweater, planner, phone, wallet, keys) and has perfectly useful pockets and a key lanyard.  Exquisite materials! I love the interior pockets. I am already planning my next purchase!All I can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot; The craftsmanship is beyond compare. I love love love this bag!I highly recommend this item and seller!It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely THE PERFECT diaper bag. I kind of went out on a limb when I decided to order online. I really like to see things in person first, but I was finding no diaper bags I liked. I found cute ones that weren&#39;t functional, or functional ones that certainly weren&#39;t cute. When I saw this one, the design caught my eye. Reading further, I saw there were 10 pockets and loved .Well this bag does not disappoint! It feels sturdy, stands on its own, is cute as a button, and doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a mom carrying around a beast of a diaper bag ;) In fact, I know I love it because I&#39;m already using it and baby&#39;s not here for another month! If you like the look, you&#39;ll love the bag.\r\n\r\nThis bag is amazing! I get compliments on it every time I go out. The pockets are perfect, one side of the bag has larger pockets for keys, checkbooks, etc and the other side is perfect for my cell phone, lip gloss and other smaller items. I do a lot of traveling for work and this is the perfect bag to take with me. It carries all my things and keeps them organized! The workmanship is beautifully done and this is easily my favorite purse. Thank you! \r\nLove this diaper bag! Good quality all around including hardware! Easy to get into with LOTS of room. Bag is sturdy without being heavy (hard to find!). Shipped fast and Owner even helped out with a special shipping request. Wrapped nicely perfect to send as gift to a new mom! Best part is supporting a small business! THANKS! It&#39;s totally worth the money!\r\n\r\nThis bag is exquisite! The french canvas is beautiful quality, the bag is expertly constructed, and the service was super fast! Any hip and trendy mom out there knows how hard it is to find a diaper bag that is both functional and stylish...I have finally found it! I know this bag will last me for years to come - through future babies, and then for my own personal use once we&#39;re beyond the diaper bag phase. Thank you for such a fabulous product! I will tell all my friends, and you can expect I&#39;ll be back for another bag or two in the future.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nIKABAGS ONLY ONE BOHEMIAN ARTISAN WOMAN !\r\nEco friendly unique

It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette \r\n\r\nHello hello Feyza,\r\nHow great was to meet you in person! I&#39;m so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.\r\n\r\nDear ikabags,\r\n\r\nWith her background as an artist, my daughter searched very hard for a beautiful,and artsy yet serviceable bag that would hold somewhat of a heavy load. \r\n \r\n Perhaps you have as part of your business objective to bring color and beauty into the mundaneness of everyday life.  Well, I was glad to buy your creation as a birthday gift for my daughter . Thank you so much. \r\n \r\n&quot;The gift you have been given, give as a gift.&quot;  Mathew 10:8(NAB) \r\n S.K\r\n==========\r\nBetween the quality and design of the bag and the amazing responsiveness and personalized attention that she provided, I really don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll ever want to buy handbags from anywhere else! I ordered the bag on Friday night, and within only a couple of hours, I had already received a response from her. Although it was the weekend and I had insisted that she did not need to rush, she had the bag made custom to order and shipped to arrive on Tuesday. The bag looks as beautiful as it appears, and the packaging was beautiful and included the personalized touch of some fresh leaves from Paris. Although many items may appear handmade, this is truly a handmade, personalized bag, and I&#39;m amazed at how much personalized attention and care she is  was able to give to me as a customer but in reading through other comments that were left, I am certainly not surprised at all b\/c my own personal experience echoed the hundreds of others! Thank you ! I have already received several compliments and have been spreading the word! I can&#39;t wait to order more!\r\n======\r\nDear Feyza,\r\nI received my bag last Monday and I&#39;m delighted with it! It worked so well on a trip we took just last week and it works well for daily use as a purse.\r\n\r\nAnd what a surprise when I was sitting in an Iowa airport for our departure home to Washington, DC when the woman sitting next to me had a bag with a bicycle flap - - it was one of your bags! What are the odds that I would meet someone in Iowa (a small predominantly rural state in the MIdwest) that had your fabulous bicycle messenger\/diaper bag! We both commented on how much we love our bags.\r\n\r\nI hope to order again from you in the future. Thank you so much for working with me to customize the bag - it&#39;s perfect! Best wishes ~ J\r\n\r\nI love your bags so much! Mine is like my best friend, great quality and unbelievably tough. I was out in a storm recently and my bag ended up completely drenched on the outside but everything inside was completely dry. So nice to wake up this morning and see you as the featured seller, well deserved!! Rebecca .\r\n\r\nThis is my 5th bag from Feyza (the seller). She is SUPER nice and helpful. The communication with her was an easy and great experience as always. She does her best to customize your needs\/queries, and she responds to your messages fast. The fabric\/texture\/color is absolutely beautiful; and the craftsman is just exquisite. I also love the key clip and  10 pockets inside. I call Feyza an ARTIST because she truly has a talent. I just can&#39;t get enough of her beautiful bags! Thank you, Feyza~ Love your work~ :)\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the picture of this bag at Ikabags, I took my iPad into my closet to see how the bag would work with my summer clothes. It&#39;s as if the designer in Paris had been able to look into my closet in Colorado and see exactly what I needed! It&#39;s perfect!! And I had no idea that turquoise is stunning with all the colors I wear! The shape of the bag and the texture of the fabric are so sophisticated. I absolutely adore this bag!! Chicest summer purse I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;m charmed by the surprise of three different fabrics on the inside. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI was looking for the perfect school bag and wasn&#39;t expecting how truly perfect this would be! It&#39;s not only handmade in Paris, France (a place I&#39;ve been preparing to visit since I was a child) by a wonderful woman with love and precision - it&#39;s so fashionable and functional at the same time! I waited only one weekend and it crossed the Atlantic and straight to Ventura County, Southern California! Packaged beautifully with ribbon and all! It&#39;s also very sturdy and can hold my big binder, a book and my laptop. My boyfriend and I loved it so much (he has an eye for beautiful things) we went out and bought a heavy weight fabric that looked the same as the interior (the Ecru color), he sewed a foam backing to the fabric and created a pen\/pencil case!!! That way, no ink or pencil marks can dirty the bag! Creative, a pleasure to talk to and talented - this shop owner is just amazing. I know where I&#39;m getting my bags from now on ;) \r\n\r\n    This is crazy. I order something from ikabags; and it makes it from Paris to Cleveland in like two days! I can&#39;t get a delivery that fast from Indiana! :) The last bag (a Mimosa) that I got from Ikabags was a smash hit as my wife&#39;s birthday present. She&#39;s been carrying it every day. It&#39;s beautifully made; elegant and sturdy. And roomy. She loves it. I&#39;m giving her this one as an end-of-the-school-year gift. It came so beautifully wrapped, that I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll have to wait until my wife opens it to actually see the bag. I don&#39;t want to spoil the gift-wrapping. I have absolutely no doubt that it will be as fine as the last one we bought. BTW... This one was custom made and out the door of her shop in about two days. Thank you!\r\n\r\n     When I emailed that the bag was a gift for my daughter in law and there were time constraints I received an immediate telephone call from France from the designer, reassuring me that the bag would be shipped that day. I received it, in New York City, the very next day. It arrived beautifully wrapped and ready to go. My daughter in law, a fashion and beauty editor, specifically requested it, so I know it will be well used. In this age of internet big box outlets and impersonal ordering, it&#39;s a pleasure to deal directly with people who care. Laura Adams New York\r\n\r\n     I am in love with this bag for so many reasons: 1. I finally have a bag that can hold all of my things without being too bulky. The well-thought-out interior pockets are of varying sizes and, even when they are all filled, there is still enough room in the middle of the bag for my large water bottle! 2. The fabric is gorgeous and unique, and I love the soft adjustable strap. Photos don&#39;t do the fabric justice! 3. The construction is impeccable and professional. 4. It was shipped so quickly... from France to MA in just a few days! I don&#39;t see myself carrying another bag ever again. Thanks for the beautiful unique product!\r\n\r\nThis transaction didn&#39;t go at ALL as I was expecting. It was 100% better! I ordered the bag on Monday evening, and it came to me on Thursday morning! Not bad coming to Canada from France! Communication was excellent. The bag is beyond beautiful! I was not expecting the material to feel so soft! Each little detail is so beautifully done! Each inner pocket fits everything I needed a pocket for! This is the most expensive purse I have ever purchased, and I would do it again in a heartbeat! In fact, I will do it again! :) Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMerci beaucoup !\r\nAll designs and Content \u00a9 2007-2015 ikabags\u2122 All rights reserved.\r\nReturn to shop: \r\nikabags.etsy.com","currency_code":"EUR","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"BONJOUR  NICIES !\r\n\r\nSHOP IS OPEN BUT I WILL AWAY FOR  MOVING NEWHOME -ATELIER 22 JAN-4 FEB 2015.\r\nBIG THANKS for your interest and for supporting my handmade work !\r\nI&#39;ve worked so hard to build. \r\n\r\n The things HANDMADE that you do need should be simple, elegant, functional, durable and beautiful.\r\nBEWARE OF IMITATIONS , THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HANDMADE ;ARTISANMADE STORE !\r\nMade from start to finish in PARIS,FRANCE\r\nTHANKS FOR BUY GOOD THINGS FROM REAL PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING ADDRESS  :\r\n* Please note that you can now view &quot;scheduled to ship by dates&quot; right on your invoice (which you can find in &quot;your account&quot; and &quot;purchases&quot;). \r\nI am trying sewing faster in humanly possibility .But please don&#39;t forget SINCE 2007 I am only ONE WOMAN working with you , working for you and yours !\r\nThank you in advance for your patience. \r\n\r\nThis note already was at Ikabags Shop Announce , at shipping details when you click before order , at policy, at profile,so i write at every where at my handmade shop  !

I do not use recycled leather, upholstery leather, or vinyl leather. This stuff is the real deal and comes from a dead animal. The above mentioned leather substitutes are great if you don&#39;t want that amazing leather smell and feel and are ok with an imitation. Because my items come from things that were once alive their hides can have imperfections. Cows like people get itches. Their anatomy doesn&#39;t allow them to reach over and scratch, so they get creative and use trees, barbwire and what ever else the can find in nature to satisfy that itch. Which can create light to dark scaring on their hides. Lucky for you though, cowboy folklore says the scars on leather hides are good luck and that cowboys would fight over who got to use them. Fortunately you don&#39;t need to fight anyone today for some good luck! The scaring is rare and will not affect the integrity of your wonderful gift.

We love what we do and appreciate the good karma involved in selling to people who love what we make.  Our goal is to make every transaction a fabulous experience, from initial order, to packaging, to your pleasure in using my handcrafted items.  Please contact me if you have any questions at all.  \r\n\r\nMy thoughts on pricing:  I am frequently approached about offering discounts, or selling  to retailers at wholesale prices.  My Etsy prices reflect a fair compensation for our time, talent, and materials.  I do not inflate my prices so that I can offer &quot;discounts&quot;.  Etsy provides a venue where I don&#39;t have to pay for additional middle-woman or distribution costs, and I prefer to pass that value on to my one-on-one customers.  So, please know that you are getting my very best pricing and although I am flattered by the requests, you will not see my bags in retail shops.","policy_payment":"If you request a custom listing, I expect the order\/payment process to be complete within 24 hours.  If I haven&#39;t heard from you by then I will assume you have made other arrangements and will delete your custom listing.  These delays cause all kinds of extra twiddling and fiddling and emailing and take me away from my sewing machine.\r\n\r\nI collect and report sales taxes on all sales within Arizona.","policy_shipping":"SHIPPING INFO:\r\nWe carefully select the most cost-effective packaging and keep it as light-weight as possible.  \r\n\r\nUpon purchasing an item from my shop, you will receive a confirmation from us with a promised shipping date. Shipping commitments are serious business here, and we keep our promises.  Please double-check the ship-to address before you order.  Obviously,we cannot honor delivery commitments if your provide the wrong address.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that handcrafted personalized goods are made after they are ordered. We are proud of our turn around times and we are fast.  But if you need your order by &quot;Friday&quot; please let us know so we can upgrade your order to RUSH\/Priority status and charge you accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter shipping thousands of packages, we have great confidence in the United States Postal Service.  However, sometimes a package is marked as delivered but does not make it into the buyer&#39;s possession - particularly when delivered to apartments.  When the US postal service tells us they have delivered the package to a correctly addressed location, we must assume theft.  Therefore, we do not issue refunds or replacements on orders identified by USPS as delivered.  \r\n\r\nWe will gladly ship to most countries.  However, we cannot  track your shipment or guarantee delivery.  Unfortunately, international packages do sometimes go astray once they leave the U.S.  \r\n\r\nInternational buyers - please see additional information below.","policy_refunds":"Again, I want you to be happy with your purchase from me.  I will jump through hoops to make that happen.  Let me know if you have any issues with my products and I will work with you to make it right.\r\n\r\nOrders cannot be returned or refunded unless the item is not as described in the listing or we have made a mistake.  In this rare event, your order will be promptly replaced.  Please read through my feedback to review the thousands of positive experiences with previous customers who left ratings.","policy_additional":"INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS - (UK CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY - PLEASE READ);\r\n\r\nBuyers are responsible for any in-bound duties\/VAT\/customs fees charged by their country.\r\n\r\nInternational customers are responsible for all import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. These fees and taxes and any additional charges for customs clearance are levied once a shipment reaches your country, and must be borne by the recipient. I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Please be aware that when customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond my original delivery estimates.

I do not use recycled leather, upholstery leather, or vinyl leather. This stuff is the real deal and comes from a dead animal. The above mentioned leather substitutes are great if you don&#39;t want that amazing leather smell and feel and are ok with an imitation. Because my items come from things that were once alive their hides can have imperfections. Cows like people get itches. Their anatomy doesn&#39;t allow them to reach over and scratch, so they get creative and use trees, barbwire and what ever else the can find in nature to satisfy that itch. Which can create light to dark scaring on their hides. Lucky for you though, cowboy folklore says the scars on leather hides are good luck and that cowboys would fight over who got to use them. Fortunately you don&#39;t need to fight anyone today for some good luck! The scaring is rare and will not affect the integrity of your wonderful gift.
